Note: All the necessary files are already included
In case the server program wants for "Pass Phrase", type "cipher" and hit enter

or we may have your own "Pass Phrase" by running the following bashes in linux terminal which will download all the necessary key files
//bash to install OpenSSL (if already not installed)
sudo apt-get install openssl
//generate private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem -aes-256-cbc
//Generate Certification Signing Request(CSR)
openssl req -new -key private_key.pem -out certificate.csr
//Generate a self_Signed certificate
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in certificate.csr -signkey private_key.pem -out certificate.crt


Below are the bashes to succesfully run the codes

//bash to compile the server code in linux terminal:
gcc -o server server.c -lssl -lcrypto
//bash to run the server code in linux terminal:
./server
//bash to compile the client code in linux terminal:
gcc -o client client.c -lssl -lcrypto
//bash to run the client code in linux terminal:
./client
